# Subset Sum

## Intro
Subset Sum problem has many variations, some of them have polynomial time solutions, some does not. Here I focus on the problem where the input are a set of positive integers and a terget positive integer. Where either some numbers from the input sum to the target, or no solution.

## Approaches
We try several different approaches to solve the issue.
### Brutal Force
### Greedy
### Dynamic Programming
### Back Track

## Summary

Subset Sum is an NP-Complete problem.
